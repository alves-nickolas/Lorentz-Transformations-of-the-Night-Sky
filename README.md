# Lorentz-Transformations-of-the-Night-Sky
One of my favorite facts about physics is that the Lorentz group in 4 dimensions is the conformal group in 2 dimensions. This means, among other things, that the effect of Lorentz transformations on the night sky seen by inertial observers is described by conformal transformations on the celestial sphere. This code snippet makes this visual.
